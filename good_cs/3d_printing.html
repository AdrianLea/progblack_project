  <h1>3D printing and the Evolution of Printing</h1>
  <h2>Printing over the years</h2>
  <p>Before the advent of the 15th Century, if somebody needed something written down, a quill and ink traditionally on linen rags was the primary method of doing so, or at least this was the case until <a href = "https://www.history.com/news/printing-press-renaissance">1436 when German goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press</a> at which point humanity was able to start producing written works faster than ever, now able to start making newspapers and mass produced books (albeit very expensive).
    From this point we developed the idea of the printing press further and further, leading to <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/this-month-in-business-history/march/typewriter-production-began">commercially available typewriters in 1868</a> to Photograph printing which uses electrically photoconductor-coated metal plates which flashes light and dries ink and finally to the development of the much more modern laser and inkjet printers around the 1950s/1960s.
    </p>
    <h2>The 3D Printer!</h2>
    <p>Undoubtedly the newest type of printer is the 3D-Printer which typically considered to use a digital 3D model which is input into a 3D printer, which will then add material together (normally plastic liquid or grains) layer by layer to recreate the digital model in a real environment.
        ***maybe something here about the development of 3d printers***
    </p>
    <h2>3D printing in current society</h2>
    <p>While 3D printing in the public eye is considered to be just a funny little machine that lets tech obsessed middle-aged men solve problems that could be solved with a £5 amazon purchase; 3D printing currently has many more environmental and medical benefits than you’d expect from r/3DPrinting.
        3D printing has been used to make creviced concrete tiles, which are attached to the sides of artificial walls in major cities throughout the world, these nooks and crannies that have allowed wildlife that used to love on the shores of these major cities to move back to their rightful home, after artificial walls removed the shorelines they used to live in, increasing biodiversity to have 19 to 51% more species and 59 to 416% more animals along the shores of these cities!
