      <p>Before the advent of the 15th Century, if somebody needed something written down, a quill and ink
        traditionally
        on
        linen rags was the primary method of doing so, or at least this was the case until <a
          href="https://www.history.com/news/printing-press-renaissance">1436 when German goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg
          invented the printing press</a> at which point humanity was able to start producing written works faster
        than
        ever, now able to start making newspapers and mass produced books (albeit very expensive).
        From this point we developed the idea of the printing press further and further, leading to <a
          href="https://guides.loc.gov/this-month-in-business-history/march/typewriter-production-began">commercially
          available typewriters in 1868</a> to Photograph printing which uses electrically photoconductor-coated metal
        plates which flashes light and dries ink and finally to the development of the much more modern laser and
        inkjet
        printers around the 1950s/1960s.

    <h2>The 3D Printer!</h2>
    <p>Undoubtedly the newest type of printer is the 3D-Printer which typically considered to use a digital 3D model
      which
      is input into a 3D printer, which will then add material together (normally plastic liquid or grains) layer by
      layer
      to recreate the digital model in a real environment.

      <p>While 3D printing in the public eye is considered to be just a funny little machine that lets tech obsessed
        middle-aged men solve problems that could be solved with a £5 amazon purchase; 3D printing currently has many
        more
        environmental and medical benefits than you’d expect from r/3DPrinting.
        3D printing has been used to make creviced concrete tiles, which are attached to the sides of artificial walls
        in
        major cities throughout the world, these nooks and crannies that have allowed wildlife that used to love on
        the
        shores of these major cities to move back to their rightful home, after artificial walls removed the
        shorelines
        they
        used to live in, increasing biodiversity to have 19 to 51% more species and 59 to 416% more animals along the
        shores
        of these cities! (information sourced from: <a
